- en: When you analyze algorithms, you often need to draw upon a body of mathematical
    tools. Some of these tools are as simple as high-school algebra, but others may
    be new to you. In [Part I](part001.xhtml), we saw how to manipulate asymptotic
    notations and solve recurrences. This appendix comprises a compendium of several
    other concepts and methods used in analyzing algorithms. As noted in the introduction
    to [Part I](part001.xhtml), you may have seen much of the material in this appendix
    before having read this book, although some of the specific notational conventions
    appearing here might differ from those you have seen elsewhere. Hence, you should
    treat this appendix as reference material. As in the rest of this book, however,
    we have included exercises and problems, in order for you to improve your skills
    in these areas.

    summations, which occur frequently in the analysis of algorithms. Many of the
    formulas here appear in any calculus text, but you will find it convenient to
    have these methods compiled in one place.'

    sets, relations, functions, graphs, and trees. It also gives some basic properties
    of these mathematical objects.'

    permutations, combinations, and the like. The remainder contains definitions and
    properties of basic probability. Most of the algorithms in this book require no
    probability for their analysis, and thus you can easily omit the latter sections
    of the chapter on a first reading, even without skimming them. Later, when you
    encounter a probabilistic analysis that you want to understand better, you will
    find [Appendix C](appendix003.xhtml) well organized for reference purposes.'

    of their basic properties. You have probably seen most of this material already
    if you have taken a course in linear algebra. But you might find it helpful to
    have one place to look for notations and definitions.'
