- en: Graph problems pervade computer science, and algorithms for working with them
    are fundamental to the field. Hundreds of interesting computational problems are
    couched in terms of graphs. This part touches on a few of the more significant
    ones.

    and then discusses algorithms based on searching a graph using either breadth-first
    search or depth-first search. The chapter gives two applications of depth-first
    search: topologically sorting a directed acyclic graph and decomposing a directed
    graph into its strongly connected components.'

    tree of a graph: the least-weight way of connecting all of the vertices together
    when each edge has an associated weight. The algorithms for computing minimum
    spanning trees serve as good examples of greedy algorithms (see [Chapter 15](chapter015.xhtml)).'

    compute shortest paths between vertices when each edge has an associated length
    or “weight.” [Chapter 22](chapter022.xhtml) shows how to find shortest paths from
    a given source vertex to all other vertices, and [Chapter 23](chapter023.xhtml)
    examines methods to compute shortest paths between every pair of vertices.'

    in a flow network, which is a directed graph having a specified source vertex
    of material, a specified sink vertex, and specified capacities for the amount
    of material that can traverse each directed edge. This general problem arises
    in many forms, and a good algorithm for computing maximum flows can help solve
    a variety of related problems efficiently.'

    methods for pairing up vertices that are partitioned into two sets by selecting
    edges that go between the sets. Bipartite-matching problems model several situations
    that arise in the real world. The chapter examines how to find a matching of maximum
    cardinality; the “stable-marriage problem,” which has the highly practical application
    of matching medical residents to hospitals; and assignment problems, which maximize
    the total weight of a bipartite matching.'

- en: When we characterize the running time of a graph algorithm on a given graph
    *G* = (*V*, *E*), we usually measure the size of the input in terms of the number
    of vertices |*V*| and the number of edges |*E*| of the graph. That is, we denote
    the size of the input with two parameters, not just one. We adopt a common notational
    convention for these parameters. Inside asymptotic notation (such as *O*-notation
    or *Θ*-notation), and *only* inside such notation, the symbol *V* denotes |*V*
    | and the symbol *E* denotes |*E*|. For example, we might say, “the algorithm
    runs in *O*(*VE*) time,” meaning that the algorithm runs in *O*(|*V*| |*E*|) time.
    This convention makes the running-time formulas easier to read, without risk of
    ambiguity.

- en: Another convention we adopt appears in pseudocode. We denote the vertex set
    of a graph *G* by *G*.*V* and its edge set by *G*.*E*. That is, the pseudocode
    views vertex and edge sets as attributes of a graph.
